The notebook provides the source code for all the analysis peformed on the spectra of hundreds of low-mass stars in the central clusters of the Carina Nebula. 

Note: Versions <8.5 of `P106_spectra_analyzer` have not been recovered from data loss and thus are not included.

The data can be downloaded from the ESO science archive:

The PID is [106.212B.001](https://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/eso/sched_rep_arc/query?progid=106.212B.001) (that link may take you straight to the dataset if google cooperates). 

For reference, the source catalog -- where we identified the stars to observe -- is [Hur et al. 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AJ....143...41H/abstract). `table1.dat` lists the`IDs` of all sources in the catalog with spectral information. 

So the star named "998" from the data collected under 106.212B.001 should correspond to star 998 in the Hur et al. catalog.
